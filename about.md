Some things are too small to publish, but too useful to forget.
That’s what this blog is for — bits, notes, reminders, and half-finished thoughts I wanted to keep somewhere.

There’s no grand vision. I’m not trying to teach or impress.
Most of this is just me thinking out loud — but if you find something helpful, I’m glad you did.

You’re welcome to look around. It’s messy, but it’s mine.
